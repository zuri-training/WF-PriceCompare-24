                <p class="pContent">The way customers shop is constantly evolving. The pandemic has transformed the “what, why, and how” of consumer preference. As people navigate new remote and flexible lives, fast and convenient delivery has become paramount. At the same time, we’re witnessing a shift to more sustainable lifestyles and modes of transportation.</p>
                <p class="pContent">Amazon Scout, our fully electric and autonomous delivery device, is helping us meet these new and rising standards, and has continued to make deliveries to our customers during the pandemic. I’m happy to share that Scout has been received with enthusiasm in the various communities in which it operates, including Snohomish County in Washington state; Irvine, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Franklin, Tennessee. Its development is an ongoing collaboration with customers, who are helping us refine various aspects of the service.</p>
                <p class="pContent">An image of kids looking at a Scout Robot in front of their house. The robot has Halloween decorations on it.As the first home to Amazon, Washington state has led the charge in helping us test this new delivery device, including customers in Everett, the largest city in Snohomish County. “Everett residents are at the forefront of innovation by pioneering Scout,” Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin said. “Their feedback on the service will help shape the future of low-emission deliveries in our community and others across the country.”</p>
                <p class="pContent">We have also had the opportunity to work with advocacy groups to make Scout more accessible. For instance, we partnered with the World Institute on Disability to test Scout’s interactions with people with disabilities. These engagements have contributed to our ongoing efforts toward improving Scout’s behavior when it encounters people with disabilities out in the world.</p>
                <p class="pContent">Rather than fundamentally changing the way we operate, Scout is designed to enhance the delivery experience for our customers. Customers order as they normally would on the Amazon app or on amazon.com and enjoy the same delivery options—including free Same-Day, One-Day, and Two-Day shipping for Prime members. Their Amazon packages are then delivered by one of our trusted partner carriers or by Scout.</p>

                    <p class="pContent">Democrats' plan to control drug prices for 180 million Americans with private health insurance has suffered yet another setback.
                    <p class="pContent">The Senate parliamentarian ruled Saturday that a core piece of the party’s plan can’t pass the chamber with fewer than 60 votes, following arguments from both parties last week.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">Albeit a blow to the majority party, which had hoped to campaign this fall on lowering drug prices for all Americans, the nonpartisan parliamentarian’s vetting means the core of the plan Democrats are trying to steer past the GOP filibuster is finally cleared for floor debate, more than a year after they began crafting the far more sweeping version once called Build Back Better.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">Yet the plan will now move forward without a provision that would have penalized drugmakers for hiking costs faster than inflation in private insurance plans as well as Medicare.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">The exclusion of the private insurance price limits means there is little left that will reduce costs for the vast majority of Americans who receive health insurance through their private sector employer. Democrats are still waiting on a separate parliamentarian ruling on their policy to cap the cost of insulin both inside and outside of Medicare.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">The decision also means tens of billions less in federal savings in the bill overall, a potential threat to Democrats' hopes of offsetting the cost for shoring up Obamacare's subsidies.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">Still, Democrats argue that the bill will move forward in the coming weeks with its most important provision intact: a repeal of the longstanding ban on the federal government directly negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the parliamentarian's ruling "good news" in a statement Saturday.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">"Medicare will finally be allowed to negotiate prescription drug prices, seniors will have free vaccines and their costs capped, and much more," he said.</p>
                    <p class="pContent">Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), a key negotiator on the House version of the bill, said the provision "would break the iron curtain Big Pharma has maintained against negotiating drug prices, and that’s game-changing. If it passes, Pharma won’t be able to continually stick it to the consumer at their will and whim. And that’s especially important with inflation hammering folks at the pump and the grocery store."</p>
